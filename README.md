* **Project Topic:** Student Loan Debt
* **Project Description:** In a world where student debt is a major topic for presidential candidates, we wanted to understand what trends 			were/are the most prevalent over the past decade. We'll try to answer: 
	* How do wages compare to student debt over a 10-year period? Is the gap widening? If so, will it continue?
	* What is the Per Capita student debt per state?
	* (Insert Question)

* **Breakdown of Tasks:**
	1. Breakdown the questions we’re trying to answer.
	2. Assign individual tasks (e.g. who will handle which question, who will validate/test, etc…)
	3. Retrieve, Assemble, and Clean the data
	4. Analyze for trends
	5. Build final report

* **Datasets:** This will help us start our research. We’ll most likely pull more data sets as we work through the data.
